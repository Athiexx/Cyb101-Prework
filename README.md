Cyb 101 prework challenge. Involved having to find 3 passwords and then entering them in their respective challenge text files. Previously, they were all named "TODO", but after inputting the correct passwords, the "main" py file will run and generate a magic key code.

Challenge was well rewarding, but the hardest one to do was challenge 3.
